- The subjunctive is mainly used in subordinate clauses and it is prompted by the use of certain verbs of emotion, volition or doubt
- For some verbs, a note is included on reflexive usage, preprosition requirements and so on


# Subject Pronouns

Proper verb conjugation requires an understanding of subject pronouns and how they are used.  Subject pronouns are words that take place of subject nous:

    Adam is English.  He lives in England.

Here "He" is replaced with a name in order to avoid repetition. 


| Degree | Singular                  | Plural                        |
|--------|----------|----------------|-------------------------------|
|        | Italian  | English        | Italian   | English           |
|-------:|----------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| First  | io       | I              | noi       | we                |
| Second | tu       | you (informal) | voi       | you               |
|        | Lei      | you (formal)   | Loro      | you (very formal) |
| Third  | lei      | she            | loro      | they              |
|        | lui      | he             |           |                   |


    var i = new Pronoun('io');


Unlike English,in Italian the verb ending is different for each person in the majority of verb tenses, so the verb inding itself identifies the subject.  For this reason, subject pronouns are superfluous and they are normally omitted when a verb is expressed.

*Vado* a Roma. | *I go* to Rome
*Vai* a Roma | *You go* to Rome


## Notes

The subject pronoun "it" (*Ãˆ*) is used when the reference is to animal or inanimate things.


# Verb Basics

In Italian, most verb forms have the following basic structure:

    root + grammatical ending 

Except in some irregular verbs, the root or stem generally does not change and expresses the meaning of the verb.  The ending, added to the infinitive stem, conveys important information including

- Person - Who or what is doing the action
- Mood - The attitude or disposition of the speaker towards the sentence
- Time - When the action takes place

For example - To sing

    "Io canto"

- Infinitive: cantare
- Infinitive Stem: (cantare - are) = cant 
- Ending: o 

In Italian, the infintive form consists of "to" + verb, for example "to speak".  In Italian, the infinitive form is one word consisting of stem + infinitive ending.  Italian regular verbs are divided into three groups according to the ending of the infinitive form.  These groups are called first, second and third conjugations.  The infinitive regular endings are *-are*, *-ere*, *-ire*.

Infinitive | Stem or Root | Infinitive Ending | Conjugation
--- | --- | ---: | ---
parl*are* (to talk) | *parl-* | -**a**re | first
ved*ere* (to see) | *ved-* | -**e**re | second
dorm*ire* (to sleep) | *dorm-* | -**i**re | third

By dropping the infinitive ending, you have the root of the verb.  Each group has its own set of endings that are added to the root and vary according to the subject, tense and mood.  The majority of *-are* verbs are regular.  The first step in mastering Italiann verbs is to become familiar with the regular endings.

The model verbs are: parlare, credere, finire and partire.

Irregular verbs don't follow the pattern of conjugation to which they belong or because they have a change in the stem.  Minor spelling changes don't make a verb irregular.  For example, verbs beloning to the *-are* group that end in *-care*, *-gare* or *-iare undergo internal spelling changes in certain tenses to preserve the hard or soft sound of the conjugated verb form.  There are no spelling changes in the second and third conjugation groups.

## Memorise Irregular Verbs
You should memorize the irregular verbs.  Only four *-are* verbs, and their compounds, are irregulare.  

- Andare
- Dare
- Fare
- Stare


# Moods and Tenses

In Italian, there are seven moods.  The four definitive moods (modi finity) are:

- **Indicative:** The most commonly used mood in everyday conversation.  It is used for ordinary statements and questions
- **Conditional:** The conditional mood allows a softening of the tone of a request or advice and it expresses what would happen yunder certain circumstances.
- **Subjunctive:** Whereas the indicative is used to express or indicate facts, the subjunctive mood conveys the opinions and attitude of the speaker.  The subjunctive often follows verbs such as *pensare* (to think).
- **Imperative** - The imperative gives a command.

There are three "indefinitive moods" or "non personal forms" (modi indefiniti), inwhich the subject remains undefined.  They are:
- **Infinitive**
- **Gerund**
- **Participle**

A Tense can be simple or compound.  The simple tenses consist of one word.

## Compound Tenses

In English, the compound tenses are also called perfect tenses.  Compound tenses are composed of two words.  The first word is the auxiliary (or "Helping") verb, and it iexpresses mainly grammatical information such as person, tense, and mood.  The other word, the past participle, expresses principally the meaning of the verb.

- I have sung
- ho cantato
- auxiliary verb: ho ("I" form, present tense)
- past participle: cantato (past participle of cantare)

In English, to form the compound tense the auxiliary berb "have" is used with the past participle - for example "she *has read* the book", "they *had gone* to the cinema".  In Italian, the auxiliary (or "helping") verbs are essere ("to be") and avere ("to have").

The perfect tenses are based on simple tenses, and they require the use of a helping verb in a simple tense plus the past participle.  Therefore, to form the Italian compound tense you should know:

- How to form the past participle
- *Avere* and *esere* in their simple tenses
- Whether to use *essere* or *avere* as an auxiliary verb

[Table - compound tenses for parlare and andare]


### Indicativo passato prossimo - Present Perfect


### Indicativo trapassato prossimo - Past Perfect


### Indicativo futuro anteriore - Future Perfect


### Indicativo trapassato remoto * - Past Perfect
*Rarely used*

### Condizionale Passato - Conditional Perfect 


### Congiuntivo passato - Equivalent to Past Subjunctive


### Congiuntivo inperfetto - Equivalent to Past Perfect Subjunctive


### Infinitivo passato - Past Infinitive


### Gerundio passato - Perfect Gerund




## The Past Participle

The English past participle is used to form the compount tenses ("he has worked", "he had worked").  The regular past participle is formed by adding the *-ed* to the verb ("watched", "liked").  Some verbs have irregular past participle ("gone" from go, "seen" from see).  In Italian, as in English, the past participle is used to form the nine compound tenses as well as to form the passive voice with *essere* or as an adjective.  The past partciple may be used as a noun.

Italian | English | Type
--- | --- | ---
Abbiamo *comprato* la casa | We have *bought* a house | compound
Siamo *andati* al cinema | We have *gone* to the cinema | compound 
La casa &egrave; stata *venduta* | The house has been *sold* | passive 
il negozio &egrave; *chiuso* | The store is *closed* | adjective
Gli *scritti* di Dante | The *writings* of Dante | noun 

### Forming the Past Participle

Verb Group | Infinitive | Past Participle
--- | --- | ---
*-are* | parl*are* ("to talk") | parl*ato* ("talked")
*-ere* | ricev*ere* ("to receive") | ricev*uto* (received)
*-ire* | fin*ire* ("to end") | fin*ito* ("finished")

Some verbs ending in *-cere* and *-iuto* when forming the past participle in order to keep the soft sound of the infinitive, as for example, *conoscere* ("to know"), *conos**cuito** * and *piacere* ("to like") *pia**cuito**.*

The past particiiples of all *-are* (with the exception of *fare*), which has a past participle of *fatto*) and most *-ire* verbs are regular and follow the above pattern.

The vast majority of *-ere* verbs have irregular past participles, and the irregularity must be memorised.  Below is a list of commonly used *-ere* verbs that have an irregular past participle:

Verb | | Past Participle | |
--- | --- | --- | ---
bere | to drink | bevuto | drunk
chiedere | to ask | chiesto | asked
chuidere | to close | chiuso | closed
decidere | to decide | deciso | decided
dipingere | to paint | dipinto | painted
dire | to say | detto  | said
leggere | to read | letto | read
mettere | to put | messo | put
perdere | to lose | perso | lost
prendere | to take | preso | took
scegliere | to choose | scelto | chosen
vincere | to win | vinto | won

Note the following on the irregular past participles:

- Many verbs ending with *-dere* and *-ndere* have past partciple ending in *-so* (for example prendere and preso; chiudere and chiuso)
- Some verbs ending with *-ncere* and *-ngere* have past participles ending in *-nto* (for example vincere and vinto; spingere and spinto)
- Some verbs ending in *-gliere* have past participles ending in *-lto* (for example scegliere and scelto; cogliere and colto)
